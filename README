SETUP

How to generate custom worksheets?
----------------------------------
1. Go to the directory where EKiD/Sources is downloaded
2. Modify "GECKO_DRV_PATH" in ConfigControls/EnvCfg to the geckodriver 
   executable location in your syatem.
3. Add the requried words to EKid/ConfigControls/WordList
4. Run "python Worksheet.py"
5. Now the expected qorksheets are at RunTimeInfo/output/
6. Advanced Settings: 
   a. Change Algo types in ConfigControls/AlgoCfg as necessary.
   b. Change Algo types in ConfigControls/FontCfg as necessary.
   c. Change Algo types in ConfigControls/ImgCfg as necessary.

Here is a sample exection flow:
    Babus-MacBook-Pro:EKiD babuneelam$ pwd
    /Users/babuneelam/EKiD
    Babus-MacBook-Pro:EKiD babuneelam$ cat ConfigControls/WordList 
    jam
    bed
    Babus-MacBook-Pro:EKiD babuneelam$ python Worksheet.py 
    Babus-MacBook-Pro:EKiD babuneelam$ ls RunTimeInfo/output/
    ws1_1.png	ws2_1.png	ws3_1.png
    Babus-MacBook-Pro:EKiD babuneelam$ 

Source Code Overview
--------------------
EKiD/Sources/
    Worksheet.py   - This is the main script
    DrawWord.py	   - This script primarily draws words & images
    GetPic.py	   - This script downloads images for the words if not already.
    CCP/           - This script processes User Config Controls 
    MyCustomFonts/ - This directory contains a third party custom dash font 

TBD
----
    - When images are downloaded from images.google.com, a firefox browser
      opens in the foreground. This need to done in the background instead.
    - When "set" Algo is configured, max_blank_chars to be auto-configured
      internally
    - Spacing between letters in a word to be adaptive (currently fixed).
    - Image Manager: to help choose more suitable image among the downloaded
      images. To choose different images when a set is generated. To let users
      customize the images. To use this information to rate image suitability.
    - Support multi-word worksheets. Say words like "Dog Cage"
    - Gracefully skip processing of words that exceed maximum allowed length.
    - Proprietary code for GetPic.py so the third party license can be avoided.
    - Proprietary custom font so customizations can be done as needed
